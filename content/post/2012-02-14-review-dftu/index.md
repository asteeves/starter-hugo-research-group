It’s just a couple more weeks until the [2012 march meeting of the American Physical Society in Boston, MA](http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR12/ "http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR12/").  Before the meeting, I’ll put up one more tutorial related to [the work that I will be presenting at APS](http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR12/Event/164980 "http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR12/Event/164980"). In the meantime, [here are some recent slides I put together](http://www.slideshare.net/qchemforqespresso/intro-to-dftu "http://www.slideshare.net/qchemforqespresso/intro-to-dftu") that provide an overview of recent developments in Hubbard augmented density functional theory (DFT+U or LDA+U/GGA+U).  


 


 **[Intro to DFT+U](http://www.slideshare.net/qchemforqespresso/intro-to-dftu "Intro to DFT+U ")**  from **[qchemforqespresso](http://www.slideshare.net/qchemforqespresso)**
 

I hope you find these slides useful.  Also check out the tutorials on [single-site DFT+U](calculating-hubbard-u "Calculating the Hubbard U"), [multiple site DFT+U](hubbard-u-multiple-sites "Hubbard U for multiple sites"), troubleshooting DFT+U ([1](troubleshooting-common-problems-dftu "Troubleshooting common problems with DFT+U") and [2](right-hubbard-u-any-element "The right Hubbard U for any element")), and dealing with low-lying electronic states ([1](low-lying-electronic-states "Low-lying electronic states") and [2](converging-and-comparing-multiple-electronic-states "Converging and comparing multiple electronic states")). Please [email me](mailto:hjkulik@mit.edu?subject=Questions%20about%20DFTU%20review "mailto:hjkulik@mit.edu?subject=Questions about PDOS and Lowdin tutorial") if you have any additional questions not answered here!
