The tutorials will be going up less frequently over the summer. These tutorials [have](all-about-tutorials "All about the tutorials") [been online for about a year now.](all-about-tutorials "All about the tutorials") So, it’s a great time to get input from you about what you’d like to see more of and also to take a look back at some of the topics covered.


 


What would you like to see next? I will prepare the next tutorial as soon as one of the topics achieves a significant (i.e. more than ten) number of votes. So, be sure to vote!


 


Previous topics:


 


1. 1)DFT+U: There have been tutorials on DFT+U including how to [calculate a Hubbard U for a single site](calculating-hubbard-u "Calculating the Hubbard U"), [multiple sites](hubbard-u-multiple-sites "Hubbard U for multiple sites"), and [periodic systems](calculating-hubbard-u-periodic-systems "Hubbard U for periodic systems").  There also was a [troubleshooting tutorial for DFT+U](troubleshooting-common-problems-dftu "Troubleshooting DFT+U") and a look at [how we calculate the U for any element](right-hubbard-u-any-element "The right Hubbard U for any element").  I’ve also [reviewed DFT+U theory](review-dftu "A review of DFT+U") and introduced some background on methods that extend [DFT+U to treat variations in bond length](including-hubbard-u-variations-dftur "Including Hubbard U variations with DFT+U(R)").

 


1. 2)Quantum chemistry: I looked at how to [converge](low-lying-electronic-states "Low-lying electronic states") and [compare](converging-and-comparing-multiple-electronic-states "Comparing multiple electronic states") different low-lying electronic states and obtain [details about populations and projected density of states](population-analysis-and-pdos "Population analysis and PDOS"). We also covered the basics of [nudged elastic band for finding transition states](nudged-elastic-band "Nudged elastic band") and how to [calculate vibrational properties of molecules](vibrational-properties-molecules "Vibrational properties of molecules").

 


1. 3) Visualization: We started with [visualizing molecular orbitals](visualizing-molecular-orbitals "Visualizing molecular orbitals"), then moved onto [visualizing and rendering with VMD/PovRay](visualizing-vmd-rendering-pov-ray "Visualizing with VMD and rendering with Povray") and how [PyMOL can be great for visualization too](more-visualization-vmd-pymol "More visualization with VMD and PyMOL"). Finally, we looked at [incorporating a feature commonly used in VMD - trajectory visualization - into PyMOL](visualizing-trajectories-pymol "Visualizing trajectories with PyMOL").

 


1. 4)Back to the basics: Finally, It can never hurt to brush up on the basics. I covered how to get started by building molecules for simulations, [testing for convergence](convergence-101 "Convergence 101"), and [graphing your data with xmgrace](quickstart-xmgrace "Quick start with xmgrace").
