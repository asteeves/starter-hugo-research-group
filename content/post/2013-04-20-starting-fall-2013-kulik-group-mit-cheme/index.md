I’m delighted to announce that I will be starting my own research group at MIT starting in the Fall in the chemical engineering department.  I will continue the tutorials here until my transition to MIT, after which there will likely be some changes in the layout and frequency. I have enjoyed making these tutorials for everyone over the past two years, and I hope you have enjoyed using them, too. I started making these tutorials in order to better explain my research in a way that is more accessible and informative than is possible in a traditional journal article format. The tutorials have evolved into a series of user-driven guides to some of the most generally useful tips and tricks in using Quantum-ESPRESSO and other visualization and graphing software. 


 



As of April 20, 2013, these tutorials have been used by people in all 50 states in the US and Washington DC and over 110 countries throughout the world. Check out a map of all the places the tutorials have been accessed from:
