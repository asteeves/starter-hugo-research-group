It’s the summer so posts will slow down a little. In the meantime, there are a few older tutorial entries that use scripts that were written for Quantum-ESPRESSO 4.x. As most of you have upgraded to Q-E 5.0 and there are small changes in how the input and output are parsed, some of these scripts and directions are no longer consistent. I will be migrating the tutorials to [hjklol.mit.edu](../ "http://hjklol.mit.edu") and updating the scripts and directions where possible. You can expect a new tutorial in late Summer (e.g. July/August).
