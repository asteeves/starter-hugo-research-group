This is the first main lecture in 10.637: Quantum Chemical Simulation, which I taught in Fall 2014 at MIT. This lecture is about an introduction to force fields and molecular mechanics. I will offer this course again in Fall 2015. The course is a mixed theoretical and practical course with six lab exercises spanning force fields to ab initio molecular dynamics. I hope you enjoy the materials! Lecture 2 of 10.637: Quantum Chemical Simulation.
