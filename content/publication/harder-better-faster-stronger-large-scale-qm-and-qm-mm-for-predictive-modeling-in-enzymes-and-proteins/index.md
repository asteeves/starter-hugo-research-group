abstract: Computational prediction of enzyme mechanism and protein function
  requires accurate physics-based models and suitable sampling. We discuss
  recent advances in large-scale quantum mechanical (QM) modeling of biochemical
  systems that have reduced the cost of high-accuracy models. Trade-offs between
  sampling and accuracy have motivated modeling with molecular mechanics (MM) in
  a multi-scale QM/MM or iterative approach. Limitations to both conventional
  density functional theory (DFT) and classical MM force fields remain for
  describing non-covalent interactions in comparison to experiment or
  wavefunction theory. Because predictions of enzyme action (i.e.,
  electrostatics), free energy barriers, and mechanisms are sensitive to the
  protocol and embedding method in QM/MM, convergence tests and systematic
  methods for quantifying QM-level interactions are a needed, active area of
  development.
