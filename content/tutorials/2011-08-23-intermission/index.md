I will be at the ACS National Meeting in Denver, CO this week presenting work on [evaluating protein structure with GPU-accelerated quantum chemistry](http://abstracts.acs.org/chem/242nm/program/view.php?obj_id=95402 "http://abstracts.acs.org/chem/242nm/program/view.php?obj_id=95402"), [the relationship between substrate placement and reactivity in non-heme iron halogenase SyrB2](http://abstracts.acs.org/chem/242nm/program/view.php?obj_id=95595 "http://abstracts.acs.org/chem/242nm/program/view.php?obj_id=95595"), and [an overview of my work in designing catalysts from first principles](http://abstracts.acs.org/chem/242nm/program/view.php?obj_id=95405 "http://abstracts.acs.org/chem/242nm/program/view.php?obj_id=95405").  


 


Check back in September for more tutorials, or drop me a line if you have [questions](mailto:hjkulikATmitDOTedu?subject=question%20about%20tutorials "mailto:hjkulikATmitDOTedu?subject=question about tutorials") [about the tutorials](mailto:hjkulikATmitDOTedu?subject=question%20about%20tutorials "mailto:hjkulikATmitDOTedu?subject=question about tutorials") or have a [special request for a tutorial topic](mailto:hkulikATmitDOTedu?subject=new%20tutorial%20topic%20request "mailto:hjkulikATmitDOTedu?subject=new tutorial topic request").
