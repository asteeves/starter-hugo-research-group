The next tutorial, which will be an extension to the earlier tutorial on [low-lying electronic states](low-lying-electronic-states "Low-lying electronic states"), will be ready in the next 1-2 weeks.  In the meantime, I’d like to get some feedback for what you’d like to see more of here.  


 


So far, there have been a few tutorials about DFT+U ([1](calculating-hubbard-u "Calculating_the_Hubbard_U"),[2](hubbard-u-multiple-sites "Hubbard U for multiple sites"),[3](troubleshooting-common-problems-dftu "Troubleshooting common problems with DFT+U")), some aimed at structural optimization issues for isolated systems ([1](quick-tip-constraining-molecular-coordinates "Quick tip constraining molecular coordinates"),[2](nudged-elastic-band "Nudged elastic band")), and a couple that focus on describing and characterizing electronic structure([1](visualizing-molecular-orbitals "Visualizing molecular orbitals"),[2](low-lying-electronic-states "Low-lying electronic states")), especially for open-shell systems.
